# Introduction

## What is RE:DOM?

RE:DOM is a tiny (2 KB) DOM library by [Juha Lindstedt](https://pakastin.fi) and [contributors](https://github.com/redom/redom/graphs/contributors), which adds some useful helpers to create DOM elements and keeping them in sync with the data.

Because RE:DOM is so close to the metal and **doesn't use virtual dom**, it's actually **faster** and uses **less memory** than almost all virtual dom based libraries, including React ([benchmark](http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark7/table.html)).

It's also easy to create **reusable components** with RE:DOM.

Another great benefit is, that you can use just **pure JavaScript**, so no complicated templating languages to learn and hassle with.

## Getting Started

> The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If you are totally new to front-end development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step.

The easiest way to try out RE:DOM is using the JSFiddle [Hello World](https://jsfiddle.net/mauroreisvieira/n3m5vajz/embedded/result,js,css) example.
Feel free to open this example in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples, or you can create an `index.html` file with the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <body>
        <script type="module">
            import { el, mount } from "https://redom.js.org/redom.es.min.js";
            const hello = el("h1", "Hello world!");
            mount(document.body, hello);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```


The [Installation](/#installation) page provides more options of installing RE:DOM.

**Note:** We do not recommend that beginners start with redom-cli, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

### UMD

RE:DOM supports [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd):

```html
<script src="https://redom.js.org/redom.min.js"></script>
<script>
    const { el, mount } = redom;
    ...
</script>
```

### ES2015

It's also possible to use the new [ES2015 import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import):

```js
import { el, mount } from "https://redom.js.org/redom.es.min.js";
```
